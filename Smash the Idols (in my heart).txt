Smash the Idols     (In my Heart)
*********************************

Tis a Holy War, in my heart,
Secret sins, manifest as Idols.
Each carries with it a lie,
To testify against me, before the Lord.

Sin blinds me, sanctity depart,
Strong delusion, against the Bible.
The Devil playing false ally,
To sever communion, with the holy God.

Tis a brawl, to tear me apart,
Be at War, Never make Peace.
Godly reproof that purify,
and smash the idols, wholly aboveboard.
