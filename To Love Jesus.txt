To Love Jesus
*************

I want to love you Lord,
Lord who told to keep thy command.
To love you, I obey you,
And obedience inspires fear of the Lord.

Sin leads to death, O Lord,
And you despise sin for it kills.
To save me from myself,
As a lifebuoy, Grant me thy Word.

I want to live in Victory,
And fear of the Lord, is Victory o'er sin.
Teach me to fear You, Lord,
Such that I may be triumphant in Christ.

Revealed in thy Word, is love,
Prefected in obidence of thy commands.
Lord, Thou are patient with me,
Punish my iniquities, Lead me in Truth.

O Generation, guided in sin,
Fear the Lord, choose life o'er death.
Divine manifestation, I seek,
That my last words be praises to Almight God.
